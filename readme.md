# ðŸŽ“ AI for Education â€” Intelligent Tutoring System

This repository contains the implementation and documentation of my Master's thesis project in **Intelligent Systems for Knowledge Extraction** at the *University of GhardaÃ¯a (Algeria)*.  
The project explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can be applied in the field of education to improve personalized learning and knowledge acquisition.

## ðŸ“˜ Abstract
The aim of this project is to design and implement an **AI-powered Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS)** that adapts learning content and recommendations based on studentsâ€™ progress and performance.  
Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques, the system analyzes student interactions and provides personalized educational support.  
This research contributes to the development of smart educational environments that promote adaptive and efficient learning through data-driven knowledge extraction.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model for personalized learning recommendations.  
- Apply knowledge extraction from educational materials using NLP techniques.  
- Analyze student interaction data to identify learning difficulties.  
- Implement a prototype Intelligent Tutoring System with adaptive feedback.  
- Evaluate system performance using standard accuracy and recommendation metrics.

## ðŸ§  Research Methodology

The methodology adopted in this work is structured into the following main stages:

1. **Literature Review**  
   - Study of AI applications in education, focusing on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and Educational Data Mining (EDM).  
   - Identification of current gaps and challenges in adaptive learning systems.

2. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Gather student performance data and textual educational materials.  
   - Apply text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and feature extraction.

3. **Knowledge Extraction & Model Development**  
   - Use NLP to extract concepts and keywords from course content.  
   - Train supervised and unsupervised ML models to predict learning paths or suggest materials.

4. **System Implementation**  
   - Build an interactive tutoring prototype (web-based or notebook-based).  
   - Integrate model predictions with a recommendation engine.

5. **Evaluation & Validation**  
   - Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and user satisfaction.  
   - Compare model results and measure improvement over baseline systems.
