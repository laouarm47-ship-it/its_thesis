# üéì Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) ‚Äì Master's Thesis Project

This repository contains the implementation and documentation of my Master's thesis project in **Intelligent Systems for Knowledge Extraction** at the **University of Gharda√Øa (Algeria)**.  
The project explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can be applied in the field of education to improve personalized learning and knowledge acquisition.

## üìò Abstract

The aim of this project is to design and implement an **AI-powered Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS)** that adapts learning content and recommendations based on students‚Äô progress and performance.  
Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques, the system analyzes student interactions and provides **personalized educational support**.  

This research contributes to the development of **smart educational environments** that promote adaptive and efficient learning through **data-driven knowledge extraction**.

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop a **machine learning model** for personalized learning recommendations.  
- Apply **knowledge extraction** from educational materials using NLP techniques.  
- Analyze **student interaction data** to identify learning difficulties.  
- Implement a **prototype Intelligent Tutoring System** with adaptive feedback.  
- Evaluate system performance using **accuracy and recommendation metrics**.
